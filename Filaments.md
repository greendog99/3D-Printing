Filaments
=========

My experience with various filaments.

Favorites
---------

eSun PLA+ - Prints great @ 200º. Layers sometimes don't adhere strongly,
which may be solved with a slightly higher printing temperature.
Expensive @ $23/kg.

Monoprice PLA+ - Very easy to print with. Comes in 1/2 kg spools @
$13 ($26/kg).

Anycubic PLA - Very easy to print with.

Comgrow/Creality PLA - Prints and looks fine.

Overture PLA - Black prints great. A bit of corner curling. Price varies.

3D Solutech PLA - Prints great. Army green is not brown enough.


Good
----

AIO Robotics PLA - a bit of stringing.

Tianse PLA - a bit of stringing on the green. Brown prints well.

Mika3D Metallic PLA - Looks great. Fairly easy to print with @ 185ºC.
Filament is slightly stretchy/spongy when warm, but this hasn't affected
print quality. Pricey ($27/kg in 3-pack of 1/2 kg spools).


Avoid
-----

Eryone PLA - Lots of warping of corners off the bed, fairly melty/globby
printing @ 185ºC.


TBD
---

Anycubic PETG - Having a lot of difficulty printing with it. Lots of
stringing, smearing, and globbing.

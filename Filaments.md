Filaments
=========

My experience with various filaments.

Favorites
---------

eSun PLA+ - Prints great @ 200–210ºC. My go-to. Expensive @ $24/kg.

ZIRO - Marble and sparkle filaments look great. Requires 210-220ºC. Expensive
and sometimes hard to get.

Good
----

Monoprice PLA+ - Very easy to print with. Comes in 1/2 kg spools @
$13 ($26/kg).

Anycubic PLA - Very easy to print with.

Comgrow/Creality PLA - Prints and looks fine.

Overture PLA - Black prints well, though a bit of corner curling.

3D Solutech PLA - Prints well. Army green is not brown enough.

AIO Robotics PLA - a bit of stringing.

Tianse PLA - a bit of stringing on the green. Brown prints well.

Mika3D Metallic PLA - Looks great. Fairly easy to print with @ 185ºC.
Filament is slightly stretchy/spongy when warm, but this hasn't affected
print quality. Pricey ($27/kg in 3-pack of 1/2 kg spools).

Avoid
-----

Eryone PLA - Lots of warping of corners off the bed, fairly melty/globby
printing @ 185ºC.

Sunlu - Spool of gray was practically unusable. Never stuck to bed, always
created a mess. Gave up and had to trash 0.8 kg of it.

TBD
---

Anycubic PETG - Difficult to print with, but sounds like that's typical with
PETG. I haven't tried any other brands yet.
